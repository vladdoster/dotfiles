# - On the main prompt: Push aside your current command line, so you can type a
#   new one. The old command line is re-inserted when you press Alt-G or
#   automatically on the next command line.
# - On the continuation prompt: Move all entered lines to the main prompt, so
#   you can edit the previous lines.

# Alt-H: Get help on your current command.

# Alt-W: Type a widget name and press Enter to see the keys bound to it.
# Type part of a widget name and press Enter for autocompletion.
